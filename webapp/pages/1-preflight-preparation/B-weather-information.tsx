                  If the proposed alternate doesn't have any IAPs, it may still be filed as an
                  alternate if the ceiling and visibility at the time of arrival at the alternate
                  would allow a descent from the MEA under basic VFR. See{' '}

                  Jeppesen charts are great for determining if an airport is suitable as an
                  alternate, because their <Link href={references.jeppesen10_9}>10-9 pages</Link>{' '}
                  list out all approaches at the airport and their associated minima. The FAA makes
                  this information available too, in the "Alternate Minimums" section of TERPS, but
                  it's not as easy to decipher and approaches with standard minima aren't included
                  at all.
