            Many pilots advocate that you mentally frame your approach as a planned missed approach
            with the option to land if things go well. This seems prudent to me.{' '}
            <Info>
              Expecting to fly the missed demands that you prepare to fly the missed, and preparing
              to fly the missed is crucial to safe flight under IFR.
            </Info>{' '}
            While descending prior to beginning your planned missed approach, if it seems like you
            may safely continue to land, then by all means to do so.{' '}
            <Warning>Just don't get so focused on landing that you forget to stay safe.</Warning>

            Doing so puts you in grave danger should you have to go missed. Sometimes there will be
            alternative approaches to the same runway which follow the exact same lateral course but
            have higher minimums--these approaches are specifically there for aircraft which are
            unable to meet the steeper gradient required to descend lower.
