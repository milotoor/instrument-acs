            Many pilots advocate that you mentally frame your approach as a planned missed approach
            with the option to land if things go well. This seems prudent to me.{' '}
            <Info>
              Expecting to fly the missed demands that you prepare to fly the missed, and preparing
              to fly the missed is crucial to safe flight under IFR.
            </Info>{' '}
            While descending prior to beginning your planned missed approach, if it seems like you
            may safely continue to land, then by all means to do so.{' '}
            <Warning>Just don't get so focused on landing that you forget to stay safe.</Warning>

            A missed approach must be flown if, upon arriving at the DA (on a precision approach) or
            MAP (on a non-precision approach) you do not have the required conditions to descend
            further. <FAR section="91.175" paragraph="c" /> delineates these requirements. See also{' '}
            <Link.Task section={6} task="E" id="k1-landing_requirements" />. Additionally,{' '}
            <Warning>
              if the approach is not stabilized by 1000 feet above TDZE you should strongly consider
              going missed.

            Once you decide to go missed, it's acceptable to immediately begin the climb. However,{' '}
            <Danger>
              you must not make any turns or deviations from the approach course until passing the
              MAP!

            The missed approach segment is a very well defined 3-dimensional "lane" that has been
