                <Bold>What direction does the airport/runway's traffic pattern look like?</Bold>{' '}
                This is important information for multiple reasons. Most importantly, on a day when
                VFR traffic might reasonably be in the pattern, you should assume that the pattern
                is occupied and plan to integrate with that traffic. Additionally, FAA legal counsel
                has issued letters of interpretation affirming that circling approaches to
                non-towered airports must make turns in the direction specified for the pattern.
                See, e.g., the{' '}
                <Link href={references.murphy_interpretation}>2009 Murphy interpretation</Link>,
                which references <FAR section={[91, 126]} />.
                <div className="pt-3">
                  In the author's humble opinion this is an absurd interpretation lacking
                  consistency with other rules of air traffic. The interpretation states that pilots
                  may request a clearance from ATC to fly a non-standard pattern{' '}
                  <Italic>at an uncontrolled field</Italic>, a request ATC doesn't have the
                  authority to grant by definition. (This particular statement was dismissed by a
                  later interpretation) Even disregarding that oddity, there are approaches where
                  circling is allowed but not permitted on the side of the airport where the traffic
                  pattern exists (e.g. the chart for the{' '}
                  <Link.Approach
                    type="RNAV (GPS)"
                    rwy={13}

                  />{' '}
                  prohibits circling southwest of runway 13-31, but runway 31 is left traffic). Any
                  reasonable pilot would determine that they should circle on the other side of the
                  airport where circling is permitted, but the Murphy interpretation ostensibly
                  makes that a violation <FAR section={[91, 126, 'b', 1]} />

              Executing the missed approach after starting to maneuver usually places the aircraft
              beyond the MAP. The aircraft is clear of obstacles when at or above the MDA while
              inside the circling area, but simply joining the missed approach ground track from the
              circling maneuver may not provide vertical obstacle clearance once the aircraft exits
              the circling area. Additional climb inside the circling area may be required before
              joining the missed approach track.
