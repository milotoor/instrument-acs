            A "circling approach" is a term used to describe several different scenarios:

              <>
                An approach aligned with a runway, but which is too steep to safely perform as a
                straight-in approach (e.g. the{' '}

            The egg-shaped area encircling the runway complex in the image above is the circling
            protected area. It is constructed by drawing circles of radius "r" at the ends of each
            runway and connecting those circles together into a{' '}
            <Link href={references.convex_hull}>convex hull</Link>. The value of "r" depends upon
            aircraft approach category and airport altitude:

            For category A aircraft (what most of us train in) the radius is either 1.3 or 1.4 NM.{' '}

              Within this area, you are guaranteed at least 300 feet of obstacle clearance.

            However, there may be notes prohibiting usage of portions of the circling area (e.g.
            "Circling NA west of Rwy 1-19", as seen on the{' '}
