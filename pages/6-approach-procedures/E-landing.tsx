              All approaches have a minimum visibility requirement, defined either in terms of

              [RVR] is required to support precision landing and takeoff operations in the NAS. The
              system measures visibility, background luminance, and runway light intensity{' '}

              ...Each RVR system consists of the following functional elements: Visibility Sensor,
              Ambient Light Sensor, Runway Light Intensity Monitor, Data Processing Unit and
              Controller Display(s). The RVR interfaces with the Automated Surface Observing System
              (ASOS), Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS), and Maintenance Processing System
              (MPS)...

                The lowest authorized ILS minimums...are: (a) Category I Decision Height (DH) 200
                feet and RVR 2,400 feet (with touchdown zone and centerline lighting, RVR 1,800
                feet).
              </Bold>
            </Quotation>
            RVR values are computed by sensors mounted on poles near the runway which transmit light
            at a known intensity and measure the extent of dissipation.

            twin, but it seems clear to me that the fault lies with the twin: (a) it elected to
