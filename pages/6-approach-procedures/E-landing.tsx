            involving a very fast twin Cessna performing a straight-in approach and a 152 in the
            pattern. The 152 may have made an error in judgment by turning base in front of the
            twin, but it seems clear to me that the fault lies with the twin: (a) it elected to
            perform a straight-in approach with VFR traffic in the pattern, and (b) it was traveling
            at a blistering <Bold>180 knot groundspeed!!!</Bold> Regardless of whose fault it is,
