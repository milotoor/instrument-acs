            Interpreting a VOR/HSI receiver and intercepting a radial should not be difficult, as
            it's required learning for the PPL. To intercept a radial, use the following steps:{' '}

            There are new usages of VORs in instrument flying, such as the <Bold>DME arc</Bold>.
            These are mostly found on approach/departure charts. The ACS gives you considerable
            leeway in maintaining the arc: you're allowed to drift off course by as much as a mile.
            How you do this is up to you, but the classic method is <Bold>"turn 10 twist 10"</Bold>:
            <BulletList type="decimal">
              <>
                As you enter the arc, turn to a heading perpendicular to the radial the arc begins
                at. For instance, if you're flying clockwise on an arc beginning at R-225, you would
                want to turn to a 315째 heading.

                <Bold>"Twist 10"</Bold>: Set the OBS to 235째 and maintain your present heading. It's
                OK to modify your heading slightly if your turn onto the arc left you a bit inside
                or outside the desired radius.{' '}
                <Info>
                  The CDI should deflect and show that you're flying in the direction to intercept.

                When the CDI re-centers, it's time to <Bold>"turn 10"</Bold>: it's exactly what it

                When it's time to exit the arc, make sure to anticipate your turn.{' '}

                  Do not wait until the CDI is centered to begin the turn exiting the arc.

            Note that the number 10 is somewhat arbitrary and not always appropriate. If the arc
            radius is quite large, turning 10째 and flying that direction until you intercept the
            radial 10 degrees further along could <Italic>theoretically</Italic> take you outside of
            the ACS tolerance of 1 mile. However, some geometry and trigonometry indicate that{' '}
            <Info>the arc radius would have to be 67 NM for this to happen</Info>, so don't fret too
            much about it. All the same, for arcs with a radius over 15 miles, consider a "turn 5
            twist 5" method instead.
