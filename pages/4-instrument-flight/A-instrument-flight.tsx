                  Instrument cross-checking and scanning is fundamental to safe instrument attitude
                  flight. The IFH defines cross-checking as "the continuous observation of the
                  indications on the control and performance instruments."{' '}
                  <Bold>No specific scanning method is recommended</Bold>; the FAA emphasizes the
                  need for pilots to individually determine which instruments give them the most
                  pertinent information for each phase of a maneuver.

                <>
                  With that said, the <Bold>selected radial cross-check</Bold> technique is standard
                  for glass panels and is the only technique discussed in the IFH chapter 6 part 2.
                  This scan keeps the pilot's eyes on the AI 80-90% of the time. This is not
                  difficulty to achieve given the large size of the AI on the PFD.
