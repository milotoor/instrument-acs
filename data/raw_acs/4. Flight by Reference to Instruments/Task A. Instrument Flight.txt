Objective To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with performing basic instrument flight maneuvers solely by reference to instruments.

Knowledge
IR.IV.A.K1 Elements related to attitude instrument flying during straight-and-level flight, climbs, turns, and descents while conducting various instrument flight procedures.
IR.IV.A.K2 Interpretation, operation, and limitations of pitch, bank, and power instruments.
IR.IV.A.K3 Normal and abnormal instrument indications and operations.

Risk Management
IR.IV.A.R1 Situations that can affect physiology and degrade instrument cross-check.
IR.IV.A.R2 Spatial disorientation and optical illusions.
IR.IV.A.R3 Flying unfamiliar airplanes, or operating with unfamiliar flight display systems and avionics.

Skills
IR.IV.A.S1 Maintain altitude ±100 feet during level flight, selected headings ±10°, airspeed ±10 knots, and bank angles ±5° during turns.
IR.IV.A.S2 Use proper instrument cross-check and interpretation, and apply the appropriate pitch, bank, power, and trim corrections when applicable.
