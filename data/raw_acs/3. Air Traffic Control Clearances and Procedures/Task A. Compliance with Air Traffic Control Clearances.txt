Objective To determine the applicant exhibits satisfactory knowledge, risk management, and skills associated with ATC clearances and procedures solely by reference to instruments.
Note: See Appendix 7: Aircraft, Equipment, and Operational Requirements & Limitations for related considerations.

Knowledge
IR.III.A.K1 Elements and procedures related to ATC clearances and pilot/controller responsibilities for departure, en route, and arrival phases of flight including clearance void times.
IR.III.A.K2 PIC emergency authority.
IR.III.A.K3 Lost communication procedures and procedures for flights outside of radar environments.

Risk Management
IR.III.A.R1 Failure to fully understand an ATC clearance.
IR.III.A.R2 Inappropriate, incomplete, or incorrect ATC clearances.
IR.III.A.R3 ATC clearance inconsistent with airplane performance or navigation capability.
IR.III.A.R4 ATC clearance intended for other aircraft with similar call signs.

Skills The applicant demonstrates the ability to:
IR.III.A.S1 Correctly copy, read back, interpret, and comply with simulated or actual ATC clearances in a timely manner using standard phraseology as provided in the Aeronautical Information Manual.
IR.III.A.S2 Correctly set communication frequencies, navigation systems (identifying when appropriate), and transponder codes in compliance with the ATC clearance.
IR.III.A.S3 Use the current and appropriate paper or electronic navigation publications.
IR.III.A.S4 Intercept all courses, radials, and bearings appropriate to the procedure, route, or clearance in a timely manner.
IR.III.A.S5 Maintain the applicable airspeed ±10 knots, headings ±10°, altitude ±100 feet; and track a course, radial, or bearing within ¾-scale deflection of the CDI.
IR.III.A.S6 Demonstrate SRM.
IR.III.A.S7 Perform the appropriate airplane checklist items relative to the phase of flight.
