[knowledge]
1 = "Procedures used if engine failure occurs during straight-and-level flight and turns while on instruments."

[risk_management]
1 = "Failure to identify the inoperative engine."
2 = "Inability to climb or maintain altitude with an inoperative engine."
3 = "Low altitude maneuvering including stall, spin, or CFIT."
4 = "Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management."

[skills]
1 = "Promptly recognize an engine failure and maintain positive airplane control."
2 = "Set the engine controls, reduce drag, identify and verify the inoperative engine, and simulate feathering of the propeller on the inoperative engine. (Evaluator should then establish zero thrust on the inoperative engine.)"
