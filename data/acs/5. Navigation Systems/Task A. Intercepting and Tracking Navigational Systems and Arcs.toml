[knowledge]
1 = "Ground-based navigation (orientation, course determination, equipment, tests and regulations) including procedures for intercepting and tracking courses and arcs."
2 = "Satellite-based navigation (orientation, course determination, equipment, tests and regulations, interference, appropriate use of databases, RAIM, and WAAS) including procedures for intercepting and tracking courses and arcs."

[risk_management]
1 = "Failure to manage automated navigation and autoflight systems."
2 = "Distractions, loss of situational awareness, or improper task management."
3 = "Limitations of the navigation system in use."

[skills]
1 = "Tune and correctly identify the navigation facility/program the navigation system and verify system accuracy as appropriate for the equipment installed in the airplane."
2 = "Determine airplane position relative to the navigational facility or waypoint."
3 = "Set and correctly orient to the course to be intercepted."
4 = "Intercept the specified course at appropriate angle, inbound to or outbound from a navigational facility or waypoint."
5 = "Maintain airspeed ±10 knots, altitude ±100 feet, and selected headings ±5°."
6 = "Apply proper correction to maintain a course, allowing no more than ¾-scale deflection of the CDI. If a DME arc is selected, maintain that arc ±1 nautical mile."
7 = "Recognize navigational system or facility failure, and when required, report the failure to ATC."
8 = "Use an MFD and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position, track wind drift, and to maintain situational awareness."
9 = "Use the autopilot to make appropriate course intercepts, if installed."
