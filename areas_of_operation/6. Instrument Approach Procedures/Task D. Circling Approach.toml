[knowledge]
k1 = "Elements related to circling approach procedures and limitations including approach categories and related airspeed restrictions."

r2 = "Executing a circling approach at night or with marginal visibility."
r3 = "Losing visual contact with an identifiable part of the airport."

[skills]
s1 = "Comply with the circling approach procedure considering turbulence, windshear, and the maneuvering capability and approach category of the aircraft."
s2 = "Confirm the direction of traffic and adhere to all restrictions and instructions issued by ATC or the evaluator."
s3 = "Demonstrate SRM."
s4 = "Establish the approach and landing configuration. Maintain a stabilized approach and a descent rate that ensures arrival at the MDA, or the preselected circling altitude above the MDA, prior to the missed approach point."
s5 = "Maintain airspeed ±10 knots, desired heading/track ±10°, and altitude +100/-0 feet until descending below the MDA or the preselected circling altitude above the MDA."
s6 = "Visually maneuver to a base or downwind leg appropriate for the landing runway and environmental conditions."
s7 = "If a missed approach occurs, turn in the appropriate direction using the correct procedure and appropriately configure the airplane."
s8 = "If landing, initiate a stabilized descent. Touch down on the first one-third of the selected runway without excessive maneuvering, without exceeding the normal operating limits of the airplane, and without exceeding 30° of bank."
