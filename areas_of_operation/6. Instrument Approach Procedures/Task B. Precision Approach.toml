[knowledge]
1 = "Procedures and limitations associated with a precision approach, including determining required descent rates and adjusting minimums in the case of inoperative equipment."
2 = "Navigation system displays, annunciations, and modes of operation."

[risk_management]
1 = "Failure to follow the correct approach procedure (e.g. descending below the glideslope, etc.)."
2 = "Selecting an incorrect navigation frequency."
3 = "Failure to manage automated navigation and autoflight systems."
4 = "Failure to ensure proper airplane configuration during an approach and missed approach."
5 = "An unstable approach including excessive descent rates."
6 = "Deteriorating weather conditions on approach."
7 = "Continuing to descend below the Decision Altitude (DA)/Decision Height (DH) when the required visual references are not visible."

[skills]
1 = "Accomplish the precision instrument approach(es) selected by the evaluator."
2 = "Establish two-way communications with ATC appropriate for the phase of flight or approach segment, and use proper communication phraseology."
3 = "Select, tune, identify, and confirm the operational status of navigation equipment to be used for the approach."
4 = "Comply with all clearances issued by ATC or the evaluator."
5 = "Recognize if any flight instrumentation is inaccurate or inoperative, and take appropriate action."
6 = "Advise ATC or the evaluator if unable to comply with a clearance."
7 = "Complete the appropriate checklist."
8 = "Establish the appropriate airplane configuration and airspeed considering turbulence and windshear."
9 = "Maintain altitude ±100 feet, selected heading ±10°, airspeed ±10 knots, and accurately track radials, courses, and bearings, prior to beginning the final approach segment."
10 = "Adjust the published DA/DH and visibility criteria for the aircraft approach category, as appropriate, to account for NOTAMs, Inoperative airplane or navigation equipment, or inoperative visual aids associated with the landing environment."
11 = "Establish a predetermined rate of descent at the point where vertical guidance begins, which approximates that required for the airplane to follow the vertical guidance."
12 = "Maintain a stabilized final approach from the Final Approach Fix (FAF) to DA/DH allowing no more than ¾-scale deflection of either the vertical or lateral guidance indications and maintain the desired airspeed ±10 knots."
13 = "Immediately initiate the missed approach procedure when at the DA/DH, and the required visual references for the runway are not unmistakably visible and identifiable."
14 = "Transition to a normal landing approach (missed approach for seaplanes) only when the airplane is in a position from which a descent to a landing on the runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvering."
15 = "Maintain a stabilized visual flight path from the DA/DH to the runway aiming point where a normal landing may be accomplished within the touchdown zone."
16 = "Use an MFD and other graphical navigation displays, if installed, to monitor position, track wind drift, and to maintain situational awareness."
